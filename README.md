**Most Importantly** : DO NOT TRY TO SCHEDULE IT MANUALLY FOR EVERY ONE MINUTE! There is a reason why I set it to 1 hour.
You can set it to a MINIMUM of 30 minutes if you like, **DO NOT TRY TO SET IT TO 1 MINUTE OR 5 MINUTES WHATSOEVER**

If anything happens to your facebook account after lowering time interval any further, ***I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE***

## ADDITIONAL NOTES FROM [Me OwO](https://github.com/izu14)

**WARNING** <br>THIS FORKED REPO BY DEFAULT USE 15 sec schedule/delay for each frame post, i saw that ESFIO(Every Spongebob Frame In Order) posted 12 frame every minutes which means they use 5 sec delay(it can be changed anytime, better to check the page or any similiar page by yourself)
<br>You can change the interval by manually editing the code located in 3rd steps section in colab notebook(line 112)

***I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN, SO PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK, I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE***

<br>**TODO**
<br>Add var form for post interval/delay
<br>Stop the code automatically after last frame posted

<br>**Btw Sorry for my bad english ;_;**
